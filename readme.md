## Permissions

### Basic Permissions

- `easytpa.tpaccept` - Allows accepting teleport requests (default: true)
- `easytpa.tpdeny` - Allows denying teleport requests (default: true)

### Permission Groups

### Permission Hierarchy

The permission system is hierarchical, meaning that higher-level permissions include lower-level ones:

- `easytpa.*` includes all permissions

## Configuration

The plugin is highly configurable through the `config.yml` file:

```yaml
# Time settings
settings:
  request-timeout: 60 # Time in seconds before a request expires
  cooldown: 30 # Time in seconds between teleport requests
  enable-sounds: true # Play sounds for teleport events

# All messages are customizable
messages:
  prefix: "&7[&6EasyTPA&7] &r"
  # ... and many more messages
```

## Installation

1. Download the correct version for your server from the releases page
2. Place the JAR file in your server's `plugins` folder
3. Restart your server
4. Configure the plugin in `plugins/EasyTPA/config.yml` (optional)

## Troubleshooting

### Java Version Issues

- **Error**: `java.lang.IllegalArgumentException: Unsupported class file major version 65`
- **Solution**: Your server is running on a Java version older than Java 21. Either:
  - Update your server to run on Java 21, or
  - Download the Java 17 compatible version of the plugin

### Permission Issues

- **Problem**: Commands not working for players
- **Solution**: Check that players have the correct permissions using `/lp user <player> permission info easytpa`

### Plugin Not Loading

- **Problem**: Plugin fails to load on startup
- **Solution**: Check your server console for error messages and ensure you're using a compatible version of Java and Minecraft
